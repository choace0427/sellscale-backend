Answers to a couple common questions I get asked:

1. _How does this work?_ -> We'll handle writing, editing, and publishing! One ask we have for you is that you share on socials once published.

2. _How much does this cost?_ -> Entirely free for you! However, we do accept donations. Typically, startups have donated anywhere from $50 to $1,000 to support our platform in the past. Any amount helps - I can send a stripe link if you'd like to support.

Title: Article on HR in the Insurance Industry
Value: The insurance industry is facing a crisis due to an aging workforce and a knowledge shortfall among new professionals entering the field. This talent gap was highlighted during the 2017 hurricane season when the demand for adjusters far exceeded the supply. The lack of experienced professionals can lead to mistakes in claims handling, ethical concerns, and ultimately harm policyholders and insurers. https://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20240205/NEWS06/912362439/Perspectives-An-industry-in-crisis-%E2%80%94-challenges-and-opportunities
